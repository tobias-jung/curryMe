America's first 18-hole golf course constructed on a sheep farm in Downer's Grove, Illinois in 1892. Businessman and golf lover Charles Blair McDonald moved to
this quaint town and began constructing the course with his colleagues. The Downer's Grove Golf Course is still intact after all of these years, although its since been downsized to 9 holes.
